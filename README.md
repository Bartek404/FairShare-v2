# FairShare v2

Second version of my JavaScript project as part of learning the language.

The calculator allows calculating a fair and proportional contribution to the household budget for both partners based on their incomes.

-----------

Other features include:

-An advanced mode that allows manually entering individual bills.

-A day/night mode based on the user's system settings.

-After the calculations, the application displays charts, one main for income division and another for the advanced mode if it's enabled.

## FAQ

#### Why does the application sometimes overestimate the contribution to the budget, for example, we need 1000, but the partners contributed 1003?


Because it's not always possible to calculate an equal contribution for both partners for the given amount, the application displays the nearest possible result.
